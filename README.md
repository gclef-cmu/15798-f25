# CMU 15-798 F25: Generative AI for Music and Audio

## Announcements

Check back here for important announcements.

## Description

This is a **graduate level course on generative AI taught through the lens of music and audio** taught by [Chris Donahue](https://chrisdonahue.com). You will learn about the methods behind state-of-the-art commercial generative AI systems such as [Suno](https://suno.com), evaluation techniques for subjective tasks, and the broader societal implications of generative AI technology.

Methods for generative AI are increasingly consolidating across modalitiesâ€”while our focus here will be on the domain-specific application of generative AI, many of the skills you learn will transfer to other modalities such as audio, images, video, or even text. A key focus will also be on writing and oral communication skills in research, which will transfer to any other research pursuit.

Major course activities will center around:

1. Reading and discussing [**research papers**](./schedule.md)
1. Completing [**programming assignments**](#assignments) in Python / PyTorch
1. Conducting an [**original research project**](./research.md) and writing a paper

See the [Syllabus](./syllabus.md) for more details.
