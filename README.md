## Description

This is a **graduate level course on generative AI taught through the lens of music and audio** taught by [Chris Donahue](https://chrisdonahue.com). We aim to study this topic _holistically_, covering everything from the **core ML methods** behind state-of-the-art music AI systems such as [Suno](https://suno.com), to principles of **interaction** with music AI systems, to the **broader societal implications** of music AI.

Methods for generative AI are increasingly consolidating across modalities. Our focus here will be on the domain-specific application of generative AI to music and audio, though many of the skills you learn will transfer to other modalities such as speech, images, video, or even text. A key focus will also be on writing and oral communication skills in research, which will transfer to any other research pursuit.

Major course activities will center around:

1. Reading and discussing [**research papers**](./schedule)
1. Completing [**programming assignments**](./activities#programming-assignments) in Google Colab / Python / PyTorch
1. Conducting an [**original research project**](./activities/final) and writing a paper

Before enrolling, please see the [Syllabus](./syllabus) and [Activities](./activities) for more details.
