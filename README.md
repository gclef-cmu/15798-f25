# CMU 15-798 F25: Generative AI for Music and Audio

This is a graduate level course on generative AI taught through the lens of music and audio. You will learn about the operation of state-of-the-art commercial generative AI systems such as Suno, evaluation techniques for subjective tasks, and the broader societal implications of generative AI technology. Methods for generative AI are increasingly consolidating across modalitiesâ€”while our focus here will be on the domain-specific application of generative AI, many of the skills you learn will transfer to other modalities such as audio, images, video, or even text. A key focus will also be on writing and oral communication skills in research, which will transfer to any other research pursuit.
