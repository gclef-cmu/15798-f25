# Activities

Here you will find information regarding all of the activities you are expected to complete in the course.

## Reading and discussing papers

Over the course of the semester, you will read [20+ research papers](../schedule) covering a wide range of topics in generative AI. We will start with a narrow focus on modern generative AI methods, and then zoom out to a broader view of music AI as a discipline that expands far beyond generation alone (music information retrieval, control, evaluation, interaction, ethics, etc.).

In a standard week (exceptions will be noted on the schedule), you will be expected to read 2 papers (one per class session) and submit reading reflections on each no later than 11:59P on the day before class. Your instructor will provide feedback both on the technical content of your reflection and the writing quality. You will also participate in in-class discussions for 3-4 papers per week, though 1-2 of these papers will be optional readings.

While you are of course welcome to read as many papers as you like, **we advise that you do not jump more than two weeks ahead in the readings**. Readings are subject to change depending on pace and interests in the class. Readings are only guaranteed to be finalized two weeks in advance. E.g., by the _start_ of week 2, the readings for week 4 will be finalized.

### Expectations and instructions

- Monitor the [schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Kafr6aprZ4euIV9A94T6k2lGxY6Tak4X1Se9j-9NcI) for the papers you are expected to read
  - Reading 1 is always mandatory
  - Reading 2 is default optional, though occasionally will be mandatory (see spreadsheet)
- Use the "Focus" column of the spreadsheet to allocate your time and attention towards the most relevant aspects of the paper
- Read the papers and [submit reading reflections](https://forms.gle/X1utGvYQXzdfkupv8) on each no later than 11:59P on the day before class
- Participate in in-class discussions for 3-4 papers per week (including optional papers which will be presented by your peers)

## Presenting papers and providing peer feedback

For 2 papers a semester (one mandatory paper and one optional paper), you will prepare a 15m oral presentation (with slides) on that paper to present to the class. Having students "divide and conquer" a set of optional readings allows us to scale up the number of papers we can cover and discuss as a group, while keeping the individual reading workload manageable.

You will [**submit peer feedback**](https://forms.gle/7ETaHrwV2UU3jxpC9) on all of the presentations you attend.

### Expectations and instructions

- Monitor the [schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Kafr6aprZ4euIV9A94T6k2lGxY6Tak4X1Se9j-9NcI) to see the papers you have been randomly assigned to present
  - Communicate any scheduling conflicts with the instructor by Friday Aug 29
  - Paper assignments will be made by the end of week 1, once conflicts are known and dust settles on adds / drops
- Prepare a 15m presentation on your assigned papers w/ a slide deck (PDF, PPT, Keynote, Google Slides are all fine)
- By 11:59P of the day _before_ your scheduled presentation, submit your slides to this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QvX1UrOk4OeqIiTu_95QQrNeW8xLbHLx?usp=drive_link). Follow the naming convention `15798 F25 - DateCode - {R1,R2} - AndrewID - Some Short Identifier`, e.g., `15798 F25 - 01B - R2 - chrisdon - Jukebox`
- Present your paper to the class, following the [format](#presentation-format) below
- Submit [peer feedback](https://forms.gle/7ETaHrwV2UU3jxpC9) on all of the presentations you attend (will be used both to provide presentation feedback for your peers and to track individual attendance)

### Presentation format

Your presentation should address the following questions as appropriate. You should not think of this as a template for _structuring_ your presentation, but instead as questions to address throughout in no particular order:

- What is the **key contribution(s)** of the paper?
- Why are this paper's contributions **impactful**?
- What **motivated** this work?
- If this paper proposes **new methods**, how do those methods work at both a high-level and a low-level?
- If this paper conducts **experiments**, how do those experiments justify the key claims or contributions?
- What did you find **surprising** about this paper?
- What **criticisms** do you have about this paper, if anything?
- What **future work** does this work point to?
- Are there **broader consequences** of this work?

Your presentation grade will be derived from peer feedback scores, so please keep the [peer presentation feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScK8RvrUsbcpHNWUy2IKKhYz-8UZ9O4q-Zr9Cn-jvQ0jcG9Kg/viewform) form in mind when preparing your presentation.

## Programming assignments

During the first half of the semester, you will complete three Python assignments which are intended to both sharpen your fundamentals and prepare you for more open-ended research.

Each assignment will have two sections: (1) a **_close-ended_ section with well-specified programming tasks**, and (2) an **_open-ended_ section with underspecified goals** aimed to encourage ambitious exploration of the topic of the assignment.

The two section design of these assignments is also intended to confront the evolving landscape of engineering and research, one where generative AI often plays an important role. It is important to both grasp the fundamentals, and to know how to use AI tools to accomplish more ambitious goals while adhering to these principles. Accordingly, your instructor expects that you **complete the initial close-ended section by hand (without AI)**, and encourages you to **use generative AI to the fullest extent in the open-ended section** to accomplish ambitious goals.

**Working in pairs.** You are expected to complete the close-ended section by yourself. After completing it, you are welcome to work with at most one other student on the open-ended section. You are each expected to turn in your own assignment submission which will also describe a clear division of labor between you and your partner on the open-ended section.

### Expectations and instructions

- Complete all assignments following the specific instructions for each below:
  - [**Assignment 1**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JV2PEtk9QOTPHmqeQBMsTuAqsJ2NtmBFUo6KTIdHfnw), **due Fri Sep 12, 11:59PM**.
  - Assignment 2, link forthcoming, **due Fri Sep 26, 11:59PM**.
  - Assignment 3, link forthcoming, **due Fri Oct 10, 11:59PM**.
- Turn in all assignments using [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/BUuyipeayt8ZwrJR8)

## Quizzes

There will be between 3 and 5 quizzes in the course (exact number to be determined) to assess your understanding of the papers we read, assignments you complete, and discussions you participate in. These quizzes will be 30m long and cover specific units (they are not cumulative). All questions will be based on the papers, discussion questions, and close-ended portions of assignments.

### Expectations and instructions

- There will be at least 3 quizzes on:
  - Sep 15 (W4A)
  - Sep 29 (W6A)
  - Oct 22 (W8B)
  - More may be announced later on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/cmu/fall2025/15798)
- You will have 30m to complete the quiz
- You may bring as many sheets of paper as you want, though you may not use electronic devices during the quiz
- Quizzes will contain a mixture of multiple choice and short answer questions
- We will not offer make-up quizzes except in the case of illness, CMU-approved accomodations, or other extenuating circumstances

## Final Project

In the second half of the semester, you will complete an [open-ended research project](./final) in music or audio AI, building on the knowledge gained through reading papers and the implementation skills gained through assignments. Your deliverables are: (1) a 6+ page research report detailing your project, (2) a 10 minute oral presentation on your project during the last week of class, and (3) peer review for 3 of your classmates' projects.

The class project will prepare you to conduct original music AI research and reason about your design choices. As a "stretch goal", you might aim to continue your research project after the end of the semester and publish it. You will almost certainly fail to develop something publication-worthy in two months, but aim to do so anyway!

**Working in pairs.** If you prefer, you may work with at most one other student on your final project. The division of labor must be made _very_ clear at both the proposal and final project submission stage.

### Expectations and instructions

- See the [final project](./final) page for more details
- Turn in all deliverables through [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/N5NdhriDQZzx7Z6H9)
