## Course Overview

This is a **graduate level course on generative AI taught through the lens of music and audio** taught by [Chris Donahue](https://chrisdonahue.com). We aim to study this topic _holistically_, covering everything from the **core ML methods** behind state-of-the-art music AI systems such as [Suno](https://suno.com), to principles of **interaction** with music AI systems, to the **broader societal implications** of music AI.

Methods for generative AI are increasingly consolidating across modalities. Our focus here will be on the domain-specific application of generative AI to music and audio, though many of the skills you learn will transfer to other modalities such as speech, images, video, or even text. A key focus will also be on writing and oral communication skills in research, which will transfer to any other research pursuit.

This is the first time this course has been offered. **Expect some bumps in the road!** Your instructor values candid feedback, so please feel free to [provide anonymous feedback at any time](https://forms.gle/7918wxczytxWu67G9). There will also be an opportunity on Oct 6 to provide anonymous/collective feedback through a session with a representative from CMU's Eberly Center.

## Major activities for the course

See the [activities](./activities) page for more details and instructions.

**Engaging with research papers:**

- Reading and writing reflections for 20+ research papers
- Participating in in-class discussions for 30+ papers
- Leading a presentation on 2 research papers
- Submitting peer feedback on presentations you attend

**Completing Python/PyTorch-based assignments** that will task you to:

- Train a music audio generation systems using latent diffusion
- Train symbolic music generation systems using language models
- Repurpose representations from a music audio generation system for music classification tasks

**Conducting original research in generative AI for music and audio:**

- Propose and execute on an original research project
- Write a 6+ page paper on your research efforts
- Present your research to your peers and participate in a single-blind peer reviewing process

## Prerequisites

- Graduate students in SCS and ECE are admitted without prerequisites, although relevant background coursework is recommended (see below).
- Other students who have already conducted related research or have relevant background coursework may be admitted at instructor discretion.

**(Informal)** To succeed in the course, it is encouraged that all students have previously taken courses in: AI/ML, deep learning, signal processing, software engineering or programming (especially Python), and algorithms. We will assume background knowledge on fundamental generative AI topics like deep learning architectures and backpropagation.

It is also recommended that students have at least some background knowledge in music (e.g., can play an instrument and read sheet music) or coursework in computer music (e.g., took 15-322/622 at CMU).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the semester, students will be able to:

- Understand the inner workings of state-of-the-art generative AI systems for music, audio, and beyond
- Engage with AI research at a scholarly level through written and oral argument
- Implement, train, and evaluate modern generative AI systems at small scales
- Conduct original research in generative AI for music and audio

These skills are designed to help you conduct original research in generative AI for multimedia like music, audio, and even language, images or video (many of the methods in generative AI are now standardized across modalities). Such research may be published in music-specific venues (ISMIR, ICASSP, NIME, ICMC, CMJ, etc.) or general AI venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, etc.). Your participation in written reading reflections and oral discussions on research papers will also help strengthen your general writing and speaking skills in research.

## Attendance

A discussion-oriented course is only productive if students are present and engaged. Accordingly, **your attendance in class is _required_**. Attendance will be tracked through the peer feedback forms you will fill out daily.

**Please do not come to class if you are ill**. Send your instructor an email or private message on Piazza and your absence will be excused. When possible, we will provide you with a Zoom link to attend remotely, or share a recording afterwards.

## Grading

The final course grade will be calculated as follows:

| Assessment                               | Total Percentage of Grade |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Reading reflections (~2 per week)        | 25% [80% is 100% Rule]    |
| Final project                            | 20%                       |
| Quizzes (3-5)                            | 15%                       |
| Assignments (3)                          | 15%                       |
| Peer presentation feedback (~4 per week) | 10% [80% is 100% Rule]    |
| Paper presentations (2)                  | 10%                       |
| Final project peer review (3)            | 5%                        |

**Note:** For Reading reflections and Peer presentation feedback, a student need only to participate in 80% of assigned material to score 100% on that assessment. A student who provides feedback on all of their classmate (ie, 100% of talks) would receive 125% for that assessment; a student who provides feedback on 60% of their classmates would receive 75% for that assessment.

I also encourage students to read the optional papers. You may submit reading reflections for optional papers if you so choose. These will count towards your total paper count, but with two caveats (1) you must have read >= 80% of the mandatory papers before any optional papers will be counted, and (2) the maximum credit you can get is 130% (32.5% absolute).

Students will be assigned the following final letter grades, based on calculations coming from the course assessment section.

| Grade | % Interval |
| ----- | ---------- |
| A     | [90, 110]  |
| B     | [80, 90)   |
| C     | [70, 80)   |
| D     | [65, 70)   |
| R (F) | [0, 65)    |

I reserve the right to adjust these intervals to be more generous, but I will not adjust them to be less so.

## Grading Policies

- **Late-work policy:** I do not accept late work or make-up work, unless you are experiencing an emergency or crisis. In this case I will be happy to work with your advisor, student services, or disability services to develop an ad-hoc make-up plan.
- **Incomplete policy:** My incomplete policy is the same as my policy for late work: incompletes will only be permitted as part of a make-up plan in collaboration with your advisor, student services, or disability services in case of crisis or emergency.
- **Attendance policy:** You are required to attend class. This will be factored into your grade implicitly via the peer presentation feedback assessment. If you fill out peer feedback for a presentation you did not attend, I reserve the right to impose a significant penalty to your grade.

## Learning Resources

- This class is writing and language-intensive. You will not be graded on the perfection of your English grammar, but you will be graded on the content, structure, clarity, and quality of your written arguments. The Student Academic Support Communication Center can help you with these skills: https://www.cmu.edu/gcc/
- You are strongly advised to scope your final project to be achievable using the computing resources you already have access to (e.g. Google Colab Pro for Education, your laptop, GPUs that you may have access to). If you are excited about an idea that requires additional compute, please talk to me about this early on (_before_ the proposal is due).

## Other Course Policies

### Academic integrity

All students are expected to be familiar with, and to comply with, the [University Policy on Academic Integrity](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html)

List of **course-specific academic integrity rules**. I reserve the right to impose a significant penalty to your grade and write you up for an academic integrity violation if you do not follow these rules.

- _Do not_ use AI to assist in writing your reading reflections. I'll know, and you won't learn anything.
- You may use AI to aid in your reading of papers, e.g., to ask clarifying questions about the material that you're reading.
- _Do not_ use AI to complete the close-ended sections of your assignments. I'll know, and you won't learn anything.
- Respect the rules for [collaboration](#collaboration) below.

### Collaboration

You must **complete the following activities entirely on your own, without consulting your peers**: reading reflections, quizzes, close-ended sections of assignments, peer presentation feedback, paper presentations, and final project peer review.

You may **complete the following activities in collaboration with at most one other peer**: open-ended sections of assignments, and the final project.

Despite these restrictions, we do want this class to feel very collaborative! There will be regular opportunities in class to work with your peers and discuss ideas in small groups.

### Accommodation

If you have a disability requiring accommodation, please contact Catherine Getchell, Director of Disability Resources, 412-268-6121, getchell@cmu.edu. If you have an accommodation letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. If you are experiencing other life circumstances for which an accommodation would be necessary, please also discuss this with me early in the semester. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate.

### Student wellness

As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. CMU services are available, and treatment does work. You can learn more about confidential mental health services available on campus at: http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Support is always available (24/7) from Counseling and Psychological Services: 412-268-2922.

### In case of emergency

If you, a family member, or a close friend are experiencing an emergency or crisis: absolutely do not worry about contacting me until you are out of the storm! In collaboration with your advisor, students services, or disability resources, we will take care of getting your coursework back on track after the crisis has passed.
